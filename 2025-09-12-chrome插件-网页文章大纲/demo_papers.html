                <div class="summary">AI-based recommender systems increasingly influence recruitment decisions.
Thus, transparency and responsible adoption in Human Resource Management (HRM)
are critical. This study examines how HR managers' AI literacy influences their
subjective perception and objective understanding of explainable AI (XAI)
elements in recruiting recommender dashboards. In an online experiment, 410
German-based HR managers compared baseline dashboards to versions enriched with
three XAI styles: important features...</div>

                <div class="summary">Tensor completion plays a crucial role in applications such as recommender
systems and medical imaging, where data are often highly incomplete. While
extensive prior work has addressed tensor completion with data missingness,
most assume that each entry of the tensor is available independently with
probability $p$. However, real-world tensor data often exhibit
missing-not-at-random (MNAR) patterns, where the probability of missingness
depends on the underlying tensor values. This paper introduce...</div>

                <div class="summary">Conversational recommender systems promise rich interactions for e-commerce,
but balancing exploration (clarifying user needs) and exploitation (making
recommendations) remains challenging, especially when deploying large language
models (LLMs) with vast product catalogs. We address this challenge by modeling
the breadth of user interest via the entropy of retrieval score distributions.
Our method uses a neural retriever to fetch relevant items for a user query and

                <div class="summary">Recent advancements in deep learning models for time series forecasting have
been significant. These models often leverage fundamental time series
properties such as seasonality and non-stationarity, which may suggest an
intrinsic link between model performance and data properties. However, existing
benchmark datasets fail to offer diverse and well-defined temporal patterns,
restricting the systematic evaluation of such connections. Additionally, there
is no effective model recommendation approa...</div>

businesses, drawing significant attention from academia and industry alike.
However, due to practical constraints, academic research remains largely

user experience through suggestions of compatible items. Accurate
classification of complementary item relationships requires reliable labels,

combines predictions of various business goals, plays a central role in
