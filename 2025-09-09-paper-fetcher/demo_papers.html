                <div class="summary">Modern search systems play a crucial role in facilitating information
acquisition. Traditional search engines typically rely on a cascaded
architecture, where results are retrieved through recall, pre-ranking, and
ranking stages. The complexity of designing and maintaining multiple modules
makes it difficult to achieve holistic performance gains. Recent advances in
generative recommendation have motivated the exploration of unified generative
search as an alternative. However, existing approache...</div>
